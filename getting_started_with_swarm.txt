Step 1: Setup Docker Swarm Cluster on Localhost

Initialize a Docker Swarm cluster on your localhost, just like before:

# Initialize Docker Swarm
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 127.0.0.1

Step 2: Create a Worker Node

Create a new Docker container to act as a worker node. You can expose specific ports on this container to simulate services running on different nodes.

# Create a Docker container acting as a worker node
docker run -d --name worker-node -p 8081:8080 docker:stable-dind

-d runs the container in the background.
--name worker-node gives the container a name.
-p 8081:8080 maps port 8080 of the container to port 8081 on the host. Adjust the ports as 

Step 3: Join Worker Node to Swarm

Join the newly created container to the Docker Swarm cluster as a worker node:

# Get join token from the manager node
docker swarm join-token worker
